// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called name and assign it the string value 'Dane'
// We check to see if the name variable is Mary (matching exactly), but it is not, so 
// we console log 'How do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called secret. We also create a variable called code and assign it the number 123
// Then we check to see if the variable code is 123, which it is, which then assigns the string value 'super'
// to the variable secret. Additionally, since the conditional is true, code is now changed to be  
// double its original value, or 246.
// Next, code is checked to see if it is greater than 250, which it is not. Therefore the variable secret
// does not change its value.  Then we console.log secret which produces 'super'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create the variable isStudent as a Boolean value of true, the variable age as a number value 34
// and the variable zip as the number 55407.
// Next, we check to see if isStudent is true AND if zip is greater than 80000. Only one of those is true
// so we move onto the first else if.  The else if checks to see if isStudent is false OR if age is less than 30.
// Both of those are false so we move to the next else if which checks if isStudent is true.  It is, so
// we now console log 'Welcome to Prime' and the process is complete, ignoring the final else.

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
// FIX - the strings of colorOne and colorTwo are reversed, so we have to switch those assignments
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {

//FIX - only colorOne is reset to purple. We also have to set colorTwo to 'purple'
colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;

// FIX - time is created as a constant. We need to use LET to make it a variable.
const time = 4;

// FIX - this is set up as an OR conditional.  We need to use && instead of ||
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;

// FIX - minAge is set up as a constant.  Though it probably should be, the directions say it's a
// variable so we need to use let instead of const.
const minAge = 21;

// FIX - while this is technically set up correctly to see if age is greater than or equal to minAge, 
// it probably will confuse some who can't read inequalities backwards. It would be advisable to switch it to
// age >= minAge
// FIX (required) - because of the switch explained above, the console.log messages are reversed. If we leave the 
// conditional statement as is we would then need to switch the console.log messages of the if and the else.  OR,
// we could just do the one recommended switch above instead of changing the two console.log messages.

if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
}
